<div class="divider-heading"></div>

With HTML5, a couple new elements were introduced to further assist with images. These are “figure” (`<figure>`) and “figure caption” (`<figcaption>`). These can be used together to easily group figures or images with associated captions.

The **figure element** is used as a container to group together one or more images with a caption. Within the figure element, you would place your image and/or related elements, as well as your caption elements.
