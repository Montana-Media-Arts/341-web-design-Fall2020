<div class="divider-heading"></div>

HTML5 includes a new data entry fields for "input elements". One such of these is the `type="date"`.

In browsers that do not support this type, a simple text box will be used. In those that do support it, the appearance will be dictated by the browser.


<div class="codepen-embed">
  <p data-height="300" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="RLjrLP" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="[Intro-Web-Dev] Topic-05: New HTML 5 Elements, Pt. 2" class="codepen"></p>
</div>


<span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> Again, this element does not have full browser support. Try this in Chrome and Opera (not Firefox or Safari).
