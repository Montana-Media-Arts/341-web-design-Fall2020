The **body element** is a container for all of the content and data that is intended to be displayed on a browser’s page.

If you want your visitors to see or have access to an element, it will nearly always be inside the `<body>`. In our analogy, we can say that the `<body>` is the physical “body” of the site that visitors meet, see, and interact with.

<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- “My Way-Cool Awesome Site!” contents, visible to visitors. -->
  </body>
</html>
```
