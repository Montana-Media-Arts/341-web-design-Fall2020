<div class="divider-heading"></div>

The _style_ element allows for simple style definitions to be established in a single HTML page without having to link to external documents. This is another element we will not use for the first few weeks but will rely upon heavily after we start looking at CSS.


<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="html">HTML</span>
</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Other meta elements -->
    <style>
      body {background-color: snow}
      h1 {color: purple}
    </style>

  </head>

</html>
```
