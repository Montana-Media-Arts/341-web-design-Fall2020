One of the primary reasons for the Internet was to be able to easily reference research when citing others, with an ability to directly “link” to their work.


## Hyperlink
In computing, a **hyperlink**, or simply a link, is a reference to data that the reader can directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering. A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document.


## Hypertext
**Hypertext** is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked is called _anchor text_. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system, and to create a hyperlink is to hyperlink (or simply to link). A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext. [<sup>\[1]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "Wikipedia - Hyperlink")

<span class="label label-info">Note</span> Link text should be specific about where the user will be going if they click a link. This means that links **should not** be simple text such as “Click Me!” Instead, good style would dictate that the link text be a description of the site, name, or information that informs the user.

  <li class="icon-con">“Want to learn more? <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline">Click here</a>!”</li>
  <li class="icon-pro">“See <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline">this page about hyperlinks</a> to learn more.”</li>
</ul>
