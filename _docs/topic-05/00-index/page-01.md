<div class="section-title">

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Additional HTML Elements</h2>
</div>


This Topic, we'll spend our time almost exclusively learning about additional HTML elements.

Starting with a quick review, we'll move into structural markup elements; specifically, various types of lists. Lists are something that are used constantly in communicating information, and HTML has very logical ways for working with lists.

We'll explore a lot of semantic markup elements that are used to add or change the meaning of text and prose. We'll also look at how to use links for other websites, as well as e-mailing.

Also, you are welcome to utilize the textbook, <a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/" target="_blank"><i>HTML & CSS</i></a>. Suggested readings will be posted on <span style="white-space:nowrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> <b>TODO</b>&nbsp;</span> pages, under the diamond logo (<img src="../img/hw-icon-duckett.svg" style="height: 20px; margin: 0px; display: inline;" />).

By the end of this Topic, we hope you:
