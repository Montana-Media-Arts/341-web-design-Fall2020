<div class="divider-heading"></div>

As stated in the introduction, the **image element** is a multi-part element comprised of several "commands" over how the image will render.

The 5 attributes an image element should include are:

1. The tag itself.
2. The source attribute.*
3. Alternative text.*
4. The image itle.
5. Width and height values (which also can be accomplished with the style attribute).

<span class="label label-danger">Important</span> *The source (`src=""`) and alternative text (`alt=""`) attributes are <b>required</b> in the image element.
