  <p>Images, unlike hyperlinks, use the URL source to retrieve additional data for the page, as opposed to sending the user to another page.</p>

  <p>As I am <i>sure</i> you can imagine, you will need use images a lot in web design and development.</p>

  <p>But like most things about the web, imagery has humble beginnings. To the right is first picture ever uploaded on the web, posted by Tim Burners Lee on behalf of a comedy band called <cite>Les Horrible Cernettes</cite>, July 18, 1992.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that the first image on the web was, in fact, Photoshopped. <a href="https://www.busbud.com/blog/exposing-the-nofilter-movement/" targe="_blank">#NoFilter</a> is a new concept, not a web Renaissance.</p>
