## Common Downloadable Video Sources

- [The Moving Image Archive](https://archive.org/details/movies)
- [Videezy](https://www.videezy.com/)
- [Pixabay](https://videos.pexels.com/)
- [Pexels](https://www.video.pexels.com/)


## How-To:

A cellphone video is a good option, or the Moving Iamge Archive has Creative Commons video that you can download, which conveniently show metadata like size and filetype. Here's an example about [Pluto](https://archive.org/details/Pluto_Flyby) using Firefox:


<div style="width: 600px; margin: auto">
  <div style="padding:66.91% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://archive.org/details/Pluto_Flyby" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div>
<br><br>

<span class="label label-success">Neat-O</span> Hovering your cursor over the download link will show you the file's size. Most videos give you the two required options you need: H.264 (`.mp4`) and an open-source type (`.ogg`).
