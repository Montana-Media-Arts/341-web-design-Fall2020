<span class="label label-warning">Load Time</span> This page contains embedded interactive content. In may take 3-10 seconds to completely load.

Instead of file-by-file uploading to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>, we can do _all_ of our work locally, and upload the completed assignment directory when finished!
