**HTML** or *HyperText Markup Language*, is one of the original markup languages and one you will be using extensively during this course. But to start, let's look at another slightly simpler and very popular markup language known as **Markdown.**

A Markdown file typically uses the `.md` extension.

For example, this page that you're reading right now is the file `markdown-files.md`.


## Markdown Usage
**Markdown files** encourage the writer to focus on *content and structure,* as opposed to formatting. In fact, this entire course has been developed for the web using Markdown files. In other words, at this very moment, you are reading a Markdown file.

This file type allows the writer to identify portions of the text as headers (at various levels), paragraphs, bold, italic, links, code, lists, and tables. It also allows the writer to easily include images through links in the document. Below is an example of Markdown.

<div class="code-heading">
  <span class="md">Markdown</span>
</div>
```markdown
